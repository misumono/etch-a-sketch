STATUS: Finished by now - uncomplete.

ORIGINAL IDEA: Idea proposed by The Odin Project. Most features originitaded from my own initiative.

ORIGINAL CODE: Yes.

TIME SPENT: 19/08/23 ~ 25/08/23

HELP RECEIVED: ChatGPT's and Google's.

THINGS I HAVE LEARNT: add event listeners and get elements. Overflow in CSS. :root in CSS. Color input. background-image and relatives in CSS (I wont stop using it, it's so much fun!) 

THINGS I HAVE TO LEARN: To remove event listeners - it is the key to finished the project as I wanted (I admit, I aimed far more higher than it was expected from me)

FEATURES I COULD NOT MANAGE TO IMPLEMENT and REASONS WHY: Change icon in real time, like in favicon.cc - from what I researched, it requires knowledge that is still unfamiliar to me.
Change brush size - I can not even imagine how to refer to surrounding divs.
Darkener and brightener - it will surely be easy to implement once I learn how to remove event listeners.

DISCARDED FEATURES and REASONS WHY: I implemented everything but features now difficult for me (the ones cited above)

LOOKING FORWARD TO: Improve and implement what I could not - may Experience make me wiser. And optimization, simplicity and cleanliness.

WILL I REVISIT and WHY WOULD I: Yes.
